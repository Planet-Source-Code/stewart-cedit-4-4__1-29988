### Description

cEdit 4.4 includes some more bug fixes that some users found along with a few more updates including a built in webbrowser as request, snippets as requested, and full template support with a simplistic template editor. The snippets you can just drag a file over the snippet window and it will be added as a snippet. This version also has a links menu it's purpose is simply to give access to some links I feel are worth while for coders :)
